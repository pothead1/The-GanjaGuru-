# The GanjaGuru

A revolutionary, AI-powered, gravity-defying cannabis metaverse PWA.

## Vision
- **Non-linear, anti-gravity interface**: Floating, orbital navigation, 3D/AR/VR, and interactive portals.
- **AI-powered e-commerce**: Seed-to-smoke, end-to-end, eco-friendly, and fully automated.
- **No inventory, no limits**: Auto-sourcing, drop-shipping, and legal compliance.

## Tech Stack
- React + Vite (PWA)
- Three.js (future AR/VR/3D)
- AI integration (OpenAI, etc.)
